# hottub_analytics

Flutter App and Flask Backend to log the temperature and heating operations of a hottub (heated with wood).  
Data is stored in MongoDB.

## Todos:
- Add visualizations of past or the current heating processes to the app.
- Make predictions of water-temperature based on the outside-temperature and other factors.

## Setup:
- Build Flutter App (i.e. with Android Studio)
- Run 'docker-compose up' inside the backend folder (NOTE: Docker-Images are intended to be used on Raspberry Pi (armv7))
